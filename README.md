### Overview

This is a community building app. With this app, we aim to help our users find their community and get to know the people around them. Users can report incidents in their neighborhood, discuss community issues, and schedule community events.

Currently, communities use platforms such as Facebook to form groups however these groups are often by invite only and are difficult to find. This app is targeted to community groups only and aims to help your community become a safer, warmer and more pleasant place to live.
